# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyrellperkins/">Tyrell Perkins</a>' IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

I built this lab to sharpen my cybersecurity skills in a practical manner, and directly tied to real-world cyber operations. With a background in enterprise IT, vulnerability management, and defensive security across global DoD environments, I’m using this space to recreate and analyze the kinds of systems, workflows, and threats I’ve either worked with, or seen throughout my career.

These projects reflect how I approach cybersecurity: structured, methodical, and focused on improving detection, response, and resilience. You’ll find work ranging from vulnerability assessment pipelines to threat detection labs using tools like Splunk, Carbon Black–style EDR simulations, secure configurations, and incident response playbooks.

If you’re interested in how I think, learn, and solve problems in modern cyber environments, this is where it all comes together.
